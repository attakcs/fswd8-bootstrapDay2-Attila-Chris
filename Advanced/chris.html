<p>Django Unchained (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/) is a 2012 American revisionist Western comedy film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, starring Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, and Samuel L. Jackson, with Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher, James Remar, Michael Parks, and Don Johnson in supporting roles. Set in the Old West and Antebellum South, it is a highly stylized tribute to Spaghetti Westerns using an obvious revisionist history, in particular the 1966 Italian film Django by Sergio Corbucci, whose star Franco Nero has a cameo appearance.
Development of Django Unchained began in 2007 when Tarantino was writing a book on Corbucci. By April 2011, Tarantino sent his final draft of the script to The Weinstein Company. Casting began in the summer of 2011, with Michael K. Williams and Will Smith being considered for the role of the title character before Foxx was cast. Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming, and Louisiana.
Django Unchained premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 11, 2012 and was theatrically released on December 25, 2012 in the United States, grossing over $425 million worldwide against its $100 million budget, becoming Tarantino's highest-grossing to-date. The film received numerous awards and nominations, including five nominations at the 85th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Waltz won several awards for his performance, among them Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTAs. For his screenplay, Tarantino won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA.</p>


<h3>Plot</h3>
<img class="rounded" id="leo" src="leo.jpg">
<p>In early 1858 Texas, brothers Ace and Dicky Speck drive a group of shackled black slaves on foot. Among them is Django, sold off and separated from his wife Broomhilda von Shaft, a house slave raised in a German household who can understand and speak both German and English. The brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter seeking to buy Django for his knowledge of the Brittle brothers (John "Big John" Brittle, Roger "Lil Raj" Brittle, and Ellis Brittle), overseers at the plantation of Django's previous owner and a trio of outlaws for whom Schultz is carrying a warrant. When the suspicious Ace levels his gun at him, Schultz kills him and wounds Dicky. Schultz insists on paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving Dicky to the newly freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. While visiting a town to collect on another bounty, Schultz offers Django his freedom and $75 in exchange for help tracking the Brittle brothers down.

They track the Brittles to the Tennessee plantation of Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, where Django and Schultz kill the three brothers. Bennett rounds up a gang to kill them, but Schultz ambushes them with an explosive, killing most of them while Django kills Bennett. Feeling morally obliged to Django, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue Broomhilda while taking him on as an apprentice and business partner. The pair return to Texas and Django soon collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill as a memento. He and Schultz have a successful winter racking up several bounties. In the spring, Django and Schultz travel to Mississippi, where they learn the identity of Broomhilda's new owner: Calvin J. Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland plantation, where slaves are forced to fight to the death in brutal wrestling matches called "Mandingo fights". Schultz and Django meet Calvin at his gentleman's club in Greenville, and offer $12,000 for one of his best fighters; however, their ulterior motive is to purchase Broomhilda. Intrigued, Calvin invites them to Candyland.

The group encounters Calvin's slave trackers en route cornering one of Calvin's disfigured Mandingo fighters, D'Artagnan, who tried to escape to avoid fighting again. Angered, Calvin has his subordinate Stonecipher sic several attack dogs at D'Artagnan, who devour him alive. After finding Broomhilda and telling her of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her as his escort while negotiating the initial deal during dinner, alongside Calvin's bodyguard Butch Pooch and his lawyer Leonide Moguy. Calvin's staunchly loyal house slave Stephen becomes suspicious and accurately deduces their plan, alerting Calvin of this as he alters the deal at gunpoint so that Broomhilda will be sold for $12,000 instead of the Mandingo fighter. Schultz reluctantly agrees, and the papers for her freedom are drawn up and signed. However, Schultz double-crosses Calvin during the finalization of the sale and shoots him dead. Pooch kills Schultz, and Django goes on a rampage, killing Pooch, Moguy and several of Calvin's gunhands, but Stephen forces him to surrender when Broomhilda is taken hostage.

The next morning, Django is tortured by Calvin's right-hand man Billy Crash, and is almost castrated, before Stephen arrives. Stephen tells Django that Calvin's sister Lara has taken charge and that he will be sold to the Australian-owned LeQuint Dickey Mining Company where he will be worked to death. En route, Django proves to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter by showing them his first handbill, tricking them into freeing him by claiming the men on the handbill are back at Candyland and promising them all but $500 of the reward money. Once released, Django kills his escorts before stealing a horse and returning to Candyland with a bag of dynamite. Having recovered Broomhilda's freedom papers from Schultz's corpse, Django vows to avenge both him and D'Artagnan. Django kills Stonecipher and several of Calvin's trackers, and frees Broomhilda from a nearby cabin, just as Calvin's mourners return from his burial. At Calvin's mansion, Django kills Crash, Lara and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen before igniting the dynamite that he has planted throughout the mansion. Django and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the mansion explodes, killing Stephen, before riding off together.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>Among those considered for the title role of Django, Michael K. Williams and Will Smith were mentioned as possibilities, but in the end Jamie Foxx was cast in the role.[13][14] Smith later said he turned down the role because it "wasn't the lead".[15] Tyrese Gibson sent in an audition tape as the character.[16] Franco Nero, the original Django from the 1966 Italian film, was rumored for the role of Calvin Candie,[17] but instead was given a cameo appearance as a minor character. Nero suggested that he play a mysterious horseman who haunts Django in visions and is revealed in an ending flashback to be Django's father; Tarantino opted not to use the idea.[18] Kevin Costner was in negotiations to join as Ace Woody,[19] a Mandingo trainer and Candie's right-hand man, but Costner dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.[20] Kurt Russell was cast instead[21] but also later left the role.[22] When Kurt Russell dropped out, the role of Ace Woody was not recast; instead, the character was merged with Walton Goggins's character, Billy Crash.[23]

Jonah Hill was offered the role of Scotty Harmony, a gambler who loses Broomhilda to Candie in a poker game,[24] but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with The Watch.[25][26] Sacha Baron Cohen was also offered the role, but declined in order to appear in Les Misérables. Neither Scotty nor the poker game appear in the final cut of the film.[24] Hill later appeared in the film in a different role.[27] Joseph Gordon-Levitt said that he "would have loved, loved to have" been in the film but would be unable to appear because of a prior commitment to direct his first film, Don Jon.[28]</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Main article: Django Unchained (soundtrack)
The film features both original and existing music tracks. Tracks composed specifically for the film include "100 Black Coffins" by Rick Ross and produced by and featuring Jamie Foxx, "Who Did That To You?" by John Legend, "Ancora Qui" by Ennio Morricone and Elisa, and "Freedom" by Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton.[37] The theme, "Django", was also the theme song of the 1966 film.[38] Musician Frank Ocean wrote an original song for the film's soundtrack, but it was rejected by Tarantino, who explained that "Ocean wrote a fantastic ballad that was truly lovely and poetic in every way, there just wasn't a scene for it."[39] Frank Ocean later published the song, entitled "Wiseman", on his Tumblr blog. The film also features a few famous pieces of western classical music, including Beethoven's "Für Elise" and "Dies Irae" from Verdi's Requiem. Tarantino has stated that he avoids using full scores of original music: "I just don't like the idea of giving that much power to anybody on one of my movies."[40][41] The film's soundtrack album was released on December 18, 2012.[37] Ennio Morricone made statements criticizing Tarantino's use of his music in Django Unchained and stated that he would "never work" with the director after this film,[42] but later agreed to compose an original film score for Tarantino's The Hateful Eight in 2015. In a scholarly essay on the film's music, Hollis Robbins notes that the vast majority of film music borrowings come from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situate Django Unchained squarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema.[43] Jim Croce's hit "I Got a Name" was featured in the soundtrack.</p>
